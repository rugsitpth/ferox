# FEROX DISCORD BOT
> Discord bot for [ARK Thailand community](https://discord.com/invite/TrPaG7qw8s)

Ferox is a bot that was created by Bell. This Ferox is powered by the [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/) ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module) API framework.

Currently, the bot is still in development under discord.js v.14.x but Ferox still had tasks that gave user roles upon request by button interaction in the specific channels.

I released version 0.1.0 (built in [Docker image rugsitpth/ferox:alpha](https://hub.docker.com/r/rugsitpth/ferox)) for microservices, this version included button interaction role and message builder via JSON.

## Requirements
Application based
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.9.0 or higher

API framework
- [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/)
